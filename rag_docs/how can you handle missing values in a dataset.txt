There are few stages to approach the missing value problem. The first stage is missing data assessment. I start by calculating missing value percentages for both columns and rows, and use visualizations like heatmaps or bar charts to understand the distribution and amount of missingness. Then, I will investigate systematic missingness. For example, a missing sale data for an entire outlet, this might indicate data acquisition errors requiring potential fixes. In the second stage, I will conduct missing data treatment. My decision on handling missing values depends on the extent and impact on the data. For columns or rows with a high missing ratio (like, more than 40%).Then if data size and diversity allow, I might further remove data with a missing value percentage exceeding a threshold (example, more than 10%).The last resort is to transform the missing value. I will consider techniques like mean/median imputation for numerical data or encoding for categorical data. I will only use this if the data size or distribution are limited. In the final stage, after any missing data treatment, I assess the final dataset for potential bias arising from missing values. This might involve checking data distribution or missing value patterns, and record down the treatment process into data cleaning record.
