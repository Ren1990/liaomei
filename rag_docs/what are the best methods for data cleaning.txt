I employed a multi-step data cleaning process specifically tailored for production data. First step is about data understanding. Prior to cleaning, I familiarized myself with the data acquisition process. This involved determining the type of data collected (raw sensor data, aggregated data), any pre-processing applied on equipment (sensor offset, aggregation), and what are the the meanings and purposes of each sensor parameter. Next step I will perfrom data integrity checks. This stage focused on identifying and rectifying inconsistencies involve checking for missing values (nulls) and duplicates, cross-referencing with the manufacturing tracking system to ensure all processed units (e.g., wafers) have corresponding data entries. After that, I will do simple exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Simple visualizations like data distribution plots and scatter plots (Y vs. X) were created to gain insights into data distribution patterns and identify potential outliers. Finally, those outliers were investigated to determine the cause and decide on appropriate treatment methods. This might involve data transformation techniques like normalization if necessary.
