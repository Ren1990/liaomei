Descriptive analysis focuses on summarizing past data to understand what has happened. Imagine analyzing historical sales data to identify trends, like a recent sales decline. Here, the biggest challenge often lies in data acquisition and cleaning. We might need to connect various data sources, join tables, and ensure data integrity by checking for duplicates, missing values, and potential biases. Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future outcomes. Building on the sales example, let's say we discover a link between sales and product features. Predictive analytics would leverage this data to train a model and predict future sales.  A common challenge here is overfitting, which can be mitigated by techniques like train-validation-test splits and cross-validation. It's also crucial to understand the business goals. For instance, if the aim is to optimize inventory based on predicted sales, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) might be more relevant than R-square during model training. Lastly for prescriptive analysis, this goes beyond prediction to recommend actions. Continuing with the sales example, after building the predictive model, prescriptive analytics could simulate the impact of different marketing budgets on predicted sales. This helps determine the optimal budget for promotions.
