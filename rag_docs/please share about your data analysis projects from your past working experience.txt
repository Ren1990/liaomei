During my time as a Senior Industrial 4.0 Analyst at Micron Semiconductor, I successfully managed smart manufacturing projects focused on smart manufacturing and digital transformation. The most important Micron project I managed is 'Virtual Metrology for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)'. We implement a virtual metrology solution for HBM, Micron's most advanced AI chip. The complex manufacturing process requires extensive metrology steps, impacting cycle time. Our solution leveraged production tool sensor data to train a predictive model (>0.8 R-squared, <10% RMSE) that could predict metrology results. This has replaced a huge amount of physical measurements, resulting in a significant reduction in cycle time through metro sampling reduction while having 100% measurement coverage for every single chip. The business impact is we are able to support the huge customer order from Nvidia for their next generation AI accelator. Another innovative Micron project is to build an internal GenAI Chatbot. I collaborated with the data engineering team to establish a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for our internal GenAI chatbot. This framework equips the chatbot with Micron domain knowledge by retrieving relevant information from Micron specific documents (manufacturing operation, tool recovery, defect investigation) to answer employee queries and summarize regarding production procedures, quality issues, and tool conversion. For company dashboard, I partnered with the worldwide equipment teams to build a tool alarm monitoring dashboard. This dashboard provided insights through charts, ticketing systems, and troubleshooting workflows. It facilitated the sharing and standardization of Best-Known Methods (BKMs) for tool recovery across all production sites. My job responsibilities include gather user requirements, commuunicate and manage dashboard features release, provide training and documentation.
