Time series analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze data points collected at regular intervals over time. Time series data consists of sequential observations recorded at specific points in time. For example, monthly sales figures. Time series analysis can be used for various purposes, such as identifying an upward or downward trend in sales over time; It can also be analyzing seasonality, do sales fluctuate predictably throughout the year? Finally it can be used for forecasting, what are the predicted sales for next month? There are few unique considerations in Time Series analysis. Time series data often exhibits seasonality (e.g., monthly sales cycles) or cyclical patterns (e.g., economic trends). These factors need to be considered when analyzing the data. For instance, when analyzing stock prices over a long period, we might need to account for inflation or economic cycles to avoid misleading interpretations. We might need to perform data transformation to address the seasonality.
