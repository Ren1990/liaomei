In my role as Senior Industry 4.0 Analyst, I will help the team to identify appropriate data sources, mostly are in Google Cloud Platform and Snowflake. Utilizing my proficiency in BigQuery and Snowflake, I performed basic data queries, including joining tables and manipulating data columns. For data exploration, analysis, and visualization, I leveraged tools like Tableau, Spotfire, JMP, and Excel to provide data insight and hypothesis to the team. While these are excellent tools for analyzing small and static datasets, they can become cumbersome for larger datasets with numerous variables (50-100+). To address this challenge, I pursued professional development in Python during my career break. I practiced using Python libraries on public datasets and participated in Kaggle and Hugging Face competitions. I leverage Python to automate tasks such as high missing value column removal, variable looping for t-tests, and summarizing potentially important variables. Furthermore, I can perform basic model training, feature engineering, and hyperparameter autotuning using Python. Finally, I used PowerPoint for presentation. I worked directly under director, we had regulary reviewes with executives from internal and external stakeholder, up VP. I have been trained to how to tell a good story in review through designing the slide and flow of presentation, and interact and influencing the audiences.
