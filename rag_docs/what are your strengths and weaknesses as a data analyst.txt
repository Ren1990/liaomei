One of my strengths is, I excel at consolidating existing resources and thinking outside the box. I believe data analysis goes beyond just analyzing data; it's about presenting insights and transforming them into actionable plans. I actively seek out additional data sources and techniques beyond initial project requirements. Other than that, I emphasize on communication and collaboration, ensuring stakeholders receive a comprehensive view. I readily collaborate with other teams to identify user needs and explore possibilities like building dashboards or automating data access. Lastly, I think I have an edge over other data specialist in domain expertise. My diverse background in engineering, manufacturing, and finance allows me to assist other data specialists with troubleshooting and hypothesis generation. For my weakness, I believe I have to focs on developing programming skills. I am actively working to improve my programming skills, particularly in Python. While I have a basic understanding of Python, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Snowflake, Jira, Streamlit, and Tableau, I sometimes rely on online resources to complete complex coding tasks. This can lead to longer completion times. However, I am a quick learner and highly motivated to overcome this limitation through dedicated learning and on-the-job training.
