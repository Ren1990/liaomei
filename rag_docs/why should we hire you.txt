I believe I possess the ideal combination of technical skills and soft skills to excel in this position. For technical data skills, I have experience using various tools for data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and visualization (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake, Tableau, Python libraries). I have gained a strong analytical foundation from working as a Semiconductor Technology Development Engineer, which dealt with problems solving and technical risk assessment. For soft skills, I am good at effective collaboration. During my tenure as Senior Industrial 4.0 Analyst, I successfully managed smart manufacturing projects and collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams (e.g., data engineers, data scientists, business units) across multiple locations (eg: US, India, China), in order to manage project progress and priority. Most importantly,I have experience in stakeholder management. I have been working directly under the director and prepare weekly/monthly presentations and newsletter updates to executives up to vice president level. I am passionate about learning. I am constantly seeking new knowledge and skills, as evidenced by my completion of CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) Level 1 and pursuit of Level 2. I have a diverse background ranging from data analysis, engineering and finance which could bring a unique perspective to data analysis. By combining my technical skills, strong communication abilities, and collaborative spirit, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team.
