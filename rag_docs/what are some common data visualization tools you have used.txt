In my data analysis experience, I've utilized a variety of tools to create impactful visualizations. For technical presentations I heavily relied on JMP and Excel to present technical and engineering data effectively; When I was Business Analyst, I transitioned to Tableau and Spotfire to create interactive dashboards that communicated insights to stakeholders and users; Throughout my professional development during career break, I've learned Python and its visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit. This allows me to automate and create more customized and interactive visualizations when needed.
